Quick start üèÅ

- Step 1: Acquire the installer. The link has a path part, so download the installer asset from the Releases page and execute it.
- Step 2: Make it executable. On Linux/macOS, you typically run chmod +x <installer-file>.
- Step 3: Run the installer. Launch the downloaded file to begin the setup process.
- Step 4: Follow on-screen prompts. The installer asks for permission to install packages and to configure tools. It uses your OS‚Äôs package manager when needed.
- Step 5: Verify the tools. After the script finishes, run claude-code, gh, and tailscale commands to confirm a working environment.

To check for updates or new releases, you can browse the Releases page again. The project emphasizes fast, hands-off setup, so you can focus on coding instead of installation chores.

How it works behind the scenes üîß

- OS detection: The installer detects your operating system, version, and architecture to choose compatible binaries.
- Dependency handling: It installs core dependencies only where needed, avoiding duplicated work on already configured systems.
- Tool orchestration: The script installs Claude Code CLI, GitHub CLI, and Tailscale in a predictable order to minimize conflicts.
- Authentication setup: It helps you authenticate each tool with minimal friction, often guiding you through interactive prompts.
- Post-install sanity checks: After installation, it runs a series of checks to ensure the tools respond correctly and the network is reachable.
- Idempotency: Running the installer again should not dramatically alter your environment, preventing unexpected changes.

Prerequisites üìã

- A machine with network access to download install assets and tool binaries.
- sudo privileges on the target machine to install system packages and configure services.
- A basic familiarity with shell commands for troubleshooting and optional customization.
- For Claude Code CLI, a Claude Code account or access method is usually required to use the service.

Install and run (step-by-step) üõ†Ô∏è

- Step A: Prepare the machine
  - Ensure your machine has a running OS supported by the installer.
  - Update the package manager cache if your OS requires it (for example, apt update or brew update).
  - Open a terminal session with access to run a script with elevated privileges.

- Step B: Download the installer asset
  - From the Releases page, pull the installer. The link provided earlier leads to the official release directory where you‚Äôll find one or more installer assets.
  - Save the asset to a known location, such as /tmp/setup-installer or your home directory.

- Step C: Make it executable
  - On Linux/macOS: chmod +x setup-installer or the actual file name you downloaded.

- Step D: Run the installer
  - Execute the script from the terminal. It will guide you through the setup steps, install the necessary tools, and configure them for first use.

- Step E: Confirm installation
  - After the script completes, run:
    - claude-code --version
    - gh --version
    - tailscale version
  - Each command should report a valid version number, confirming successful installation.

- Step F: First-time authentication and configuration
  - Claude Code CLI: The installer may prompt you to log in or provide an API key. Follow the prompts to complete the auth flow.
  - GitHub CLI: The installer can trigger gh auth login with a browser-based flow or token-based method. Choose the method you prefer.
  - Tailscale: The installer can link you to a login flow or apply a pre-authenticated session. Complete the login to enable secure networking.

- Step G: Optional post-install improvements
  - Set up environment variables for convenience, such as CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN, or TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY, if your workflow requires them.
  - Add shell aliases for quick access to the tools.

- Step H: Validation
  - Create a small test repository on GitHub and try a couple of basic operations with gh.
  - Start a Claude Code session or command to see results.
  - Verify that tailscale connect works by pinging another device on your TailNet.

Notes on usage

- The installer aims to be safe to run on fresh machines and to avoid disrupting existing configurations beyond what is necessary to enable the tools.
- If you run into permission issues, re-run the installer with elevated rights or check the specific steps where the script requests sudo access.
- If a tool already exists on the machine, the installer will attempt to upgrade or reuse existing installations where feasible.

Post-install configuration and customization üß≠

- Claude Code CLI
  - Explore Claude Code features, commands, and workflows. The CLI provides a range of actions such as initiating conversations, uploading files, or querying code intelligence.
  - Authentication flows vary by environment. If you use a corporate network or proxy, you may need to configure that proxy in your CLI settings.

- GitHub CLI (gh)
  - The gh tool enables repository management, issue handling, and code reviews directly from the terminal.
  - You can set a default GitHub host if you use GitHub Enterprise Server, and you can configure multiple authentication methods.

- Tailscale
  - Tailscale creates a private mesh between devices. You can connect your server to your personal devices, making SSH and other services accessible securely across locations.
  - Use tailscale status to review your current mesh, tailscale ping to test connectivity, and tailscale up to initialize a new device.

- Environment variables and secrets
  - CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY: If Claude Code requires a key, set it in your environment or a credentials store.
  - GITHUB_TOKEN: For non-interactive GitHub CLI usage, store a token with the required scopes.
  - TailScale secrets: If you manage keys or pre-auth keys, store them in a secure store and reference them in your shell or startup scripts.

- Shell configuration
  - Add helpful aliases to your shell profile, such as:
    - alias claude="claude-code"
    - alias ghc="gh config set -h github.com"
    - alias tails="tailscale"
  - Keep your PATH clean and avoid shadowing system commands.

Advanced usage and customization üìà

- Custom install paths
  - If you need the tools installed to bespoke locations, you can override default paths via environment variables or script flags, depending on the installer‚Äôs design. Review the installer‚Äôs help output to see supported flags.
- Non-root installations
  - If you don‚Äôt have sudo access, the installer may offer a user-local installation path in which it installs tools under your home directory. This keeps the system untouched while enabling command-line usage.
- Logging and diagnostics
  - The installer typically logs to a dedicated log file in /var/log or your home directory. If something goes wrong, review the log to identify the stage where the setup failed.
- Reusing credentials safely
  - When possible, prefer reading credentials from a secure store or keychain rather than embedding them in shell profiles. Limit the scope and lifetime of tokens to reduce risk.

Security and privacy üîí

- The installer connects to official sources to download binaries. It validates checksums where available to guard against tampering.
- Treat sensitive tokens and keys with care. Do not commit credentials to public repositories or share them in logs.
- When using Tailscale, ensure your mesh is scoped to devices you trust and that you enable appropriate access controls.
- Regularly audit installed tools for updates and security patches. The project supports a straightforward upgrade path through new releases.
